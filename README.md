## Welcome to Bodhi !


#### Some Questions

* Does ocean of information that is *The Internet* overwhelms you ?
* Do you find it difficult to discover the best video on learning fraction on internet ?
* How about doing some exercise once you have learnt what is set theory ?
* Don't you think you should understand how laviation works with live video and experiments rather then reading about it ?


#### Bodhi is the answer

We are first starting with Gujarat Secondary Education Board and will hopefully support other curriculums as well. While we are at it, you are free to fork the repo and start it for other school boards.
